"I agree, I guess."\n\nBoston forward Marcus Morris added his assessment.\n\n"Gooning? That\'s a good word," Morris said. "S---, we\'re doing what it takes. Whatever it takes, every player, 1 to 15, whatever it takes, that\'s what we\'re doing. You call it what you want to call it.

"We go out there, we compete. It\'s Celtics basketball. We\'re really embracing Celtics basketball. We\'re playing hard. We\'ve got each other\'s backs, and that\'s it."\n\nIt was the Cavs who crossed the line from playing hard to playing dangerous when JR Smith shoved an already-airborne Horford in the back with 3:37 remaining in the fourth quarter, resulting in a flagrant foul 1 on Smith following a review by the officials.\n\n"It was a good call," Smith said. "I blatantly pushed him. It wasn\'t like I was trying to low-bridge him or something to make sure he didn\'t get it. It was a good, hard foul. I can understand why they gave me a flagrant."\n\nAfter the shove, Marcus Smart got in Smith\'s face, causing Smith to push the Celtics guard away and leading to technical fouls being called on both players.\n\n"Oh, man, we\'re out there to play basketball," Smart said. "You know, and I just looked at it: Al is a defenseless person. He\'s in the air. He can\'t control how his body goes, and he\'s not even looking. And you go and take two hands to the back; that\'s a dirty shot. You just can\'t allow that to keep happening."\n\nSmith has a history of run-ins with the Celtics in the playoffs. In Game 4 of the first round in 2015, Smith was called for a flagrant foul 2 for striking then-Boston forward Jae Crowder in the face. Smith received a two-game suspension.\n\n"That\'s not the first time JR has done some dirty stuff, especially playing against us," Smart said after Tuesday\'s contest. "He\'s known for it, especially playing against us. We know that. So, you know, it\'s like a bully: You keep letting a bully keep picking on you, he\'s going to pick on you until you finally stand up, and that\'s what I tried to do.

"We have each other\'s backs, and it is what it is. We moved on to the next play, and we just locked in even more after that."\n\nWhile the referees were consulting the replay monitor, the TD Garden crowd broke out into a loud chant of, "F--- you, JR!"\n\n"I love it," Smith, who shot 0-for-7, said of the jeers. "I don\'t want the opposing fans to like me. That\'s not why I\'m here. They can chant and scream all they want; it actually makes me feel better about myself. They know me."\n\nThe Celtics also engaged in some extracurricular activities after Tristan Thompson fouled Morris in the third quarter and Morris screamed in Thompson\'s face while both forwards were still on the floor, all of which led to the two needing to be separated.\n\n"Does it matter?" Thompson asked in response to a question regarding what Morris said. "I\'m not a Chatty Patty, so you\'re going to have to ask him that. That s--- don\'t matter to me."\n\nWhat did matter to Thompson was how Cleveland responded to Boston\'s physicality overall.\n\n"They\'re going to play physical," Thompson said. "They got to. That gets them going, and they\'ve got players that are gritty players that play hard. That\'s their edge, that\'s what they bring to the table. Guys got to be ready for that. And if you\'re not ready, then you can\'t play."\n\nWhile Smith didn\'t use any verbiage like "gooning" to describe the Celtics, he said he expected the conference finals to be hard-fought.\n\n"We knew they were a young, extremely scrappy team," Smith said. "We watched previous series and how they played; they played hard all the time, extremely well-coached. Surprised? No, I\'m not surprised at all. They play hard."\n\nNow the Cavs have to bring the fight to Game 3 at home on Saturday.\n\n"We\'ve got to be tougher, mentally and physically," Lue said. "We\'ve got to come out swinging. We\'ve got to be aggressive. I think we\'ve got to be physical, and we\'ve got to have a physical mindset, you know, that they\'re coming in, playing tough. They\'re aggressive, and we\'ve got to match that."'

(0:50)\n\nBOSTON -- On a night when Marcus Smart did all the typical Marcus Smart things -- diving into the crowd to save a loose ball, standing up for a teammate after a hard foul, making a timely steal when his team needed it most -- everyone from his teammates to LeBron James gushed about the impact he has when he\'s on the court.\n\nThe Celtics improved to 8-2 since Smart returned from thumb surgery late in Boston\'s first-round triumph over the Milwaukee Bucks, and his combination of hustle, grit and toughness has moved Boston to two wins away from an improbable trip to the NBA Finals.\n\nSmart finished with 11 points on a mere 3-of-9 shooting but added nine assists, five rebounds and four steals over 31 minutes in Boston\'s 107-94 triumph in Game 2 at TD Garden. Smart was a team-best plus-21 overall in plus/minus.\n\nThose numbers can\'t quantify some of his most impactful moments.\n\n"He was born with his hands dirty," Celtics teammate Jaylen Brown said. "I\'m just happy he\'s on our side. Today was a tremendous effort on one of the biggest stages we\'ve all played on. I commend Smart for coming with that hard hat that he always has."\n\nEditor\'s Picks Heavy lies the East crown, a burden Boston has yet to weigh Up 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals, the Celtics are showing the vigor of an upstart contender. Meanwhile, LeBron James once again looks mired in the morass of organizational fatigue.\n\nCeltics not bothered by Lue\'s \'gooning\' remark Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said after Game 2 that the Celtics are "gooning the game up." Several Boston players brushed off the remark and said they are just playing hard.\n\nLeBron plays on in Game 2 despite strained neck A strained neck wasn\'t enough to keep down LeBron James, who suffered the injury in the second quarter of Tuesday\'s Game 2 but missed less than two minutes of game action. 2 Related\n\nSmart missed the final 15 games of the regular season after tearing a ligament in his right thumb while diving for a loose ball in a game against the Indiana Pacers on March 11. He was cleared to return for Game 5 of Boston\'s series against the Bucks, and his efforts that night might have prolonged Boston\'s season.\n\nIn Tuesday\'s Game 2, it was quintessential Smart, as his handprints were all over Boston\'s rally from a double-digit first-half deficit, and then salted away the win late.\n\nThe Celtics were clinging to a single-digit lead early with under nine minutes to play when Marcus Morris misfired on a jumper. Smart, who had been jousting with Kevin Love under the basket, swooped behind Jeff Green, who had hauled in the rebound, and managed to poke the ball free. As it bounced in front of the Cavaliers\' bench, Green just watched while Smart lunged to tap the ball out to teammate Jayson Tatum before sailing into the feet of the Cavaliers coaching staff and the fans seated courtside.\n\nThe Celtics didn\'t score on the possession, but it exemplified the effort that Boston put in while rallying out of a double-digit first-half hole and keeping the Cavaliers at arm\'s length in the final frame.\n\nCleveland was up 11 in the final minute of the first half, but Smart assisted on a Morris bucket, then picked off a James feed near midcourt before feeding Morris again to trim the deficit to seven.\n\n"I think Marcus always makes plays at the right time," said James, who raved about Smart\'s ability to play multiple positions and impact the game as a creator.\n\nMarcus Smart did a little bit of everything for the Celtics in Tuesday\'s Game 2 win and even earned the praise of the Cavaliers. Jesse D. Garrabrant/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nIt was Smart who confronted Cleveland\'s J.R. Smith for what Smart believed was a dangerous push of a defenseless Al Horford late in the fourth quarter. Smith got a flagrant foul, and Smith and Smart were assessed double technicals for their flare-up.\n\n"One of my guys was down, and I took offense to it," Smart said.\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens knows that the stats can\'t quite measure Smart\'s impact.\n\n"I think he\'s as tough as they come, right? He\'s a true competitor," Stevens said. "He matches his intensity with a physical toughness.\n\n"People talk about him all the time. Sometimes they focus on things that don\'t matter, and the other times they focus on that he impacts winning. We are really glad he\'s on our team."\n\nCavaliers coach Ty Lue was asked about Smart\'s impact and noted, "Same impact he always has: just winning basketball. He makes winning plays. He makes tough plays. If it\'s 50/50 balls, he\'s going to get it. If it\'s a loose ball, offensive rebound they need to have, he\'s going to get it. We\'ve got to be able to find someone who can match his toughness."'

(1:08)\n\nCHICAGO -- The Phoenix Suns\' most important victory of the year came Tuesday, as the franchise won the 2018 NBA draft lottery.\n\nBarring a trade, this will be the Suns\' first No. 1 overall pick in franchise history. After a league-worst 21-61 season, Phoenix had the best odds to win the lottery.\n\n"It\'s a historic day for the franchise," Suns general manager Ryan McDonough said while clutching the No. 1 envelope that the Suns logo appeared from to win the first pick.\n\nThis is the fourth straight season in which the team with the best chance to end up with the No. 1 selection got the top spot.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings will select second, and the Atlanta Hawks will go third. The NBA draft is June 21 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n2018 NBA draft Get ready for Deandre Ayton, Luka Doncic, Trae Young and more top prospects. • Full NBA mock draft\n\n• Scouting the likely lottery picks\n\n• Top 100 rankings\n\n• Who\'s in, who\'s testing?\n\n• Draft assets for every team\n\nThe Suns have an interesting decision to make, as the franchise has some familiarity with two of the top prospects in this year\'s draft.\n\nBig man DeAndre Ayton is expected to be one of the first players selected next month, and he played in the Suns\' backyard at Arizona. He averaged 20.1 points and 11.6 rebounds in his only season with the Wildcats, earning the Pac-12 Player of the Year award. The 7-foot center dominated the NCAA to the tune of 24 double-doubles on the season, the second most by a freshman in Division I history, behind only Michael Beasley, who recorded 28 in 2007-08 for Kansas State.\n\nSwingman Josh Jackson, the fourth overall pick in last year\'s draft, was the Suns\' representative at the lottery. Afterward, he said he knows whom he wants the team to select.\n\n"For me personally I would have to say DeAndre Ayton," Jackson told ESPN while discussing which prospect he thought would fit best with Phoenix. "A kid I\'ve been knowing for five or six-plus years. I\'ve watched him grow from a freshman to a senior in [high school], and I\'ve seen him improve every year, adding something more to his game. Before his shot wasn\'t really that good and now you got to respect it. You can\'t leave him open because he can knock it down. He\'s got so much potential and he\'s such a hard worker, that\'s probably who I would go with."\n\nReal Madrid\'s Luka Doncic has been on NBA radars for a while, earning the 2016-17 EuroLeague Rising Star award while growing his game overseas. At 19, Doncic already has the type of professional experience that scouts salivate over as he transitions to the NBA.\n\nNew Suns coach Igor Kokoskov coached Doncic as the pair helped lead Slovenia to a gold medal in last year\'s European championship.\n\n"We\'ll certainly weigh it pretty heavily," McDonough said of their relationship. "He\'s our head coach and has a good track record of evaluating players, developing players. Obviously he and Doncic have a great history together having won the European world championships and Doncic is a phenomenal talent who\'s certainly in the mix for the No. 1 pick for us. At the same time, a few other guys who are in this room tonight are in [the mix] as well. And knowing Igor he\'ll have strong opinions on Luka and I know how he feels about Luka and the special connection they have. At the same time, he\'ll want us to draft the best player, whoever we think the best player is, whoever stands out throughout the process."\n\nJosh Jackson and his Suns teammates will get some help in the draft after landing the No. 1 overall pick. AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast\n\nAnother possible candidate at No. 1 is Duke freshman Marvin Bagley III, who became the first Blue Devil in history to lead the ACC in scoring and rebounding, averaging 21.0 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. The 19-year-old helped lead Duke to the Elite Eight, becoming one of just five players in a major conference over the past 25 years to average 20-plus points and 10-plus rebounds and shoot 60 percent or higher from the field in a season. That list includes Ayton, Oklahoma\'s Blake Griffin (2008-09), Wake Forest\'s Tim Duncan (1996-97) and Northwestern\'s Evan Eschmeyer (1997-98).\n\nMcDonough hopes the top selection can give the Suns the kind of star power that will carry them into the next phase of their rebuilding process.\n\n"Hopefully it gives us another foundational player to build around," he said. "We feel like we have one in Devin Booker, we feel like Josh Jackson has the potential to be one, he certainly made strides over the second half this past season. Usually in the NBA it takes three elite players to win at a high level. We feel like we have the potential to hopefully develop that and then add in free agency. So it\'s big for us, it\'s big for our franchise, I think it will be a jolt of energy and excitement into our fan base and we can\'t wait for the draft on June 21."\n\nWhen told that Jackson wants the Suns to select Ayton, McDonough chuckled.\n\n"I was hoping it was unanimous," McDonough said. "That would make my job easier. I guess we got a decision to make."\n\nThe Suns, in fact, have several decisions to make as they own four picks in June\'s draft -- two each in the first round (Nos. 1 and 16) and the second round (Nos. 31 and 59).\n\nThis is the 10th straight year the Kings have picked in the top 10. The team has not made the playoffs since 2006, the longest active drought in the NBA.\n\nThe Hawks, who recently hired Lloyd Pierce as their head coach, have their highest draft pick since they selected Al Horford at No. 3 overall in 2007.\n\nThis is the final year of this lottery system. Next season, the three worst teams in the regular season each will have the same 14 percent chance to win the lottery. This year the Suns, who finished dead last in the league, had a 25 percent chance to win the lottery, while the Memphis Grizzlies had a 19.9 percent chance and the Dallas Mavericks had a 13.8 percent chance. The Grizzlies and Mavs landed at Nos. 4 and 5, respectively.\n\nThe rest of the lottery slotted as follows: Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, New York Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers, Charlotte Hornets, LA Clippers (picks Nos. 12 and 13) and Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe Cavs, who are playing the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, likely had higher hopes for what became the No. 8 pick. Cleveland acquired what was the Brooklyn Nets\' pick from Boston in the Kyrie Irving trade.\n\nCleveland general manager Koby Altman, though, believes the team will find a valuable player there.\n\n"I think when I, as we\'ve gone through the process this year, I think this is a really deep draft," Altman said. "If I was sitting with [No.] 8 in past years, I might not say that. I think 8 is very valuable this year."\n\nAltman was also asked if he would consider trading the pick to find a veteran to play alongside LeBron James in hopes of enticing the four-time MVP to re-sign with the team.\n\n"We have every intention of diving into who we can get in this draft and how it can help our team," Altman said.\n\nMcDonough, who called the final few minutes before the pick was revealed "torture," beamed as he spoke of the lottery luck the Suns received. Jackson, who noted one of his lucky charms was a pair of underwear he wore to the event, acknowledged the tension in the room.\n\n"Before they started to call out the teams and the picks I was really nervous," Jackson said. "I didn\'t have any control over it but I was still really nervous. After they got down to the bottom three, I got to be a little more confident knowing that we would get the No. 1 pick."\n\nThe look of happiness and relief on both of their faces was mixed with a level of optimism within the organization that hasn\'t been felt in several years.\n\n"I hate to say this because Joel (Embiid) says it all the time -- it\'s a process," Jackson said. "It really is. It\'s not a race, everybody can\'t win, so you got to kind of be able to take your losses on the chin and just know that one day it will be your turn. And you just got to stay focused and keep working and be willing to wait. "\n\nJackson stood on stage with the Suns logo card after the lottery, taking pictures and smiling for all to see.\n\n"I\'m not letting this go," he said.\n\nInformation from ESPN\'s Dave McMenamin was used in this report.'

I\'m pretty cried out, so I didn\'t tear up or anything. It felt so good, and coming around third I was immediately thinking of my mom," said Piscotty.\n\nThe team had given Piscotty the option to sit out Tuesday, when he got a ride to the airport around 3:45 a.m. in California for a flight to Boston. Piscotty, who said he still felt like he was on West Coast time, declined the option.\n\n"He wanted to play. He\'s on little sleep, a lot of adrenaline,\'\' Oakland manager Melvin said. "I know he was really- looking forward to that first at-bat. To be able to do what he did tells you a little seething about him.\'\'\n\nAdded Melvin: "To hit a home run in his first at-bat like that, there\'s something in the air. Probably Gretchen ... It was like a walkoff. The guys just embraced him when he got in the dugout.\'\'\n\nTo make room for Piscotty and with Trevor Cahill (elbow) expected to return from the disabled list on Wednesday, the A\'s also optioned right-hander Kendall Graveman to Triple-A Nashville.\n\nGraveman, called up last Friday, earned his first win of the year in a solid start against the Yankees and was scheduled to start Wednesday against the Red Sox. He\'s 1-5 with a 7.60 ERA over seven starts with the A\'s this season.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.'

"The Patriots, obviously, I respect their coach, I respect Bill [Belichick], I respect Tom Brady, but just because the way that they won the Super Bowls, the Patriot Way, is that how everybody else is supposed to do the same thing? No, it\'s not. And that\'s what I got mad at, the arrogance by them.\n\n"There was obviously some stuff behind closed doors. Their owner talking s--- to our owner. Bill talking s--- to our head coach [Doug Pederson] before the game. I\'m not going to say it, but a lot of s--- kind (of) built up to that, and I just got tired of hearing about it, man, to be honest."\n\nJohnson has not been shy about sharing his feelings on the Patriots. Following the Eagles\' win over the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC Championship Game, Johnson immediately turned his sights to New England, calling Brady a "pretty boy" and saying "there\'s nothing I\'d like to do more than dethrone that guy."\n\nAfter the Super Bowl, he described the Patriots as a "fear-based organization" with players who "act like f---ing robots." He doubled down on that assessment when asked about the mystery surrounding Belichick\'s decision not to play cornerback Malcolm Butler in the Super Bowl.\n\n"That\'s the thing, you\'re never going to know," Johnson said. "Whatever they\'re told to do in the media is what they\'re told to do. Like I said, they\'re robots."\n\nThe Eagles defeated the Patriots 41-33 to claim their first Lombardi trophy.\n\n"I saw a [Patriots] defense that wasn\'t overly talented. It was all really about containing Tom Brady," Johnson said on the Austin podcast. "We had a hard time doing that -- he had 505 yards. But that was really it, man. Going into the game, I\'m not going to be shell-shocked by it. That was kind of our thing going in. I think we had the upper hand on that."'

Editor\'s Picks Weaknesses that could sink MLB\'s 10 best teams From big names who aren\'t producing to positions providing nothing, we identify flaws that could derail contenders.\n\nWhich contenders are in trouble and what they can do about it? The Dodgers looked like postseason locks, but now they\'re among the clubs whose playoff odds have taken a big hit.\n\nHow can MLB\'s unluckiest hitters turn their year around? Anthony Rizzo is one of several star sluggers not producing like they used to. Before anyone pushes the panic button, here\'s why they\'ll bounce back. 2 Related\n\n1. The Colorado Rockies (29.4 percent playoff odds) need corner help. According to Baseball Reference-version WAR, the Rockies rank 25th in WAR produced by right fielders (minus-0.3), 28th in left-field WAR (minus-0.4) and last at first base (minus-1.2). This is not a small-sample issue. These are positions that were in need and remain in need.\n\nThe Rockies got a weighted runs created (wRC+) mark of 79 from their right fielders last season -- 100 wRC+ is league average -- largely due to Carlos Gonzalez\'s poor season. They nevertheless brought Gonzalez back on a one-year deal, and he is again struggling. The Rockies ranked 29th among first basemen (87 wRC+) last season. The Rockies signed Ian Desmond to play first base last season, and he struggled, producing a 69 wRC+, which means he was 31 percent below league average when adjusting for the ballpark and scoring environment. This season? He has been historically poor, hitting .175/.219/.365 as his zone contact rate has dropped and his ground ball rate has spiked. He has produced 38 wRC+, which is essentially a pitcher\'s bat playing at a corner position. David Dahl has not been able to take ownership of a position, as his bat has slumped. In left field, Gerardo Parra hasn\'t hit.\n\nThe Rockies were a wild-card team last year and are contending again in the NL West. They knew these were positions of need and did little to address them. The Rockies were projected by FanGraphs to rank 27th in first-base production (1.0 WAR), 28th among right fielders (0.3) and 30th among left fielders (minus-0.4) entering the season. The good news? Those should be among the easiest positions to fill, as corner bats such as Logan Morrison and Yonder Alonso were modestly valued by the industry in free agency. Targeting the corner players of teams already deep in rebuilds, such as Miami first baseman Justin Bour or White Sox corner bat Matt Davidson, could help fill these voids at relatively affordable returns.'
